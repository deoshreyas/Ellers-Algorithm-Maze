# Ellers-Algorithm-Maze

## :zap: About
This is a little visualisation tool I made to visualise Eller's algorithm for generating mazes and then solving them using the A* Path Finding algorithm.

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
Just clone the repository on your machine, and run `main.py`. You might need to install a few packages, like `pygame`.

## :grey_question: Controls
- Press `<SPACE>` to generate a maze.
- Then mark the start and end points.
- Press `<ENTER>` to search using A*
- Press `c` to clear the maze.
- If you want to use a bigger or smaller base grid, just change `CELL_SIZE` in the source code.
- If you want to change the colours or mess with the time settings, just change the values in the source code (it is super easy to understand)!
